      <h3>About Me</h3>
      <section></section>
      <p>
        My name is Christina Kaufman and I am a fourth year student at the
        University of Iowa. I am from Oak Brook, IL and grew up with two older
        sisters, whom I look up to greatly. At Iowa, I swam on the University's
        Swimming and Diving team for two years. I was given the opportunity to
        attend the BigTen Championship both years and lead as an Iowa Student
        Athlete Advising Commitee member in the second year. In the Tippie
        College of Business, I currently lead as President of Women in Business.
        WIB is a 300 member student organization focused on breaking down the
        common barriers that women face throughout their every day lives.
        Because of my leadership, I was nominated for Tippie Top 21 and
        Oustanding Woman in Business during my final semester at Iowa.
      </p>
      <p>
        As a motivated learner and hard worker, I strive to give my all to
        everything and will take the initiative to lead whenever required. I am
        a Business Analytics student from the University of Iowa, working
        towards a certificate in leadership studies, and the President for Women
        in Business; I make effective, analytical decisions and work at my
        fullest capacity, whether in an independent or group setting. In the
        future, I am determined to play an important role in aiding companies to
        achieve success.
      </p>
